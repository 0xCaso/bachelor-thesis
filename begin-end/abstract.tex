\chapter*{Abstract}

Nowadays, most of our data is owned by private companies, and everyone knows 
everything about us because privacy online is not well preserved. Imagining a 
world different from this is difficult, but things can change thanks to 
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI).\\
SSI's approach aims to bring credentials back to the actual owners, the people.
This is possible through cryptography and secure authentication layers 
(e.g., OAuth, OpenIDConnect).\\
The developed product embraces this philosophy and offers a solution where the 
users are the holders, issuers, or verifiers of VCs (Verifiable Credentials). 
Specifically, will be developed software agents who create, issue, verify, 
modify or even revoke the credentials, leveraging an SSI Kit.\\\\
% Ultimately, we will merge this solution with the blockchain, a sort of 
% transparent and distributed database, where we can make public what we truly want to 
% share (e.g., credentials verification by a trusted verifier).\\\\
This paper describes in detail Matteo Casonato's (approx.) three hundred hours 
of internship at the company Athesys S.r.l. (actually, working for its 
sub-startup Monokee). The goal was to merge SSI off-chain (i.e., outside the 
blockchain) operations with on-chain smart contracts.\\
In particular, the job has been divided into three macro stages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Deep dive into the SSI technology, studying all of its primitives 
    and problem analyzation;
    \item Development of a Software Development Kit (SDK), which enabled us 
    to dialog with an SSI Kit (off-chain logic); in the meantime, my friend 
    and co-worker Matteo Midena developed the smart contracts (on-chain logic);
    \item Merge off-chain and on-chain solutions in a proof of concept web 
    application.
\end{enumerate}
